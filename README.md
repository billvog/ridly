# Ridly

An outdoor treasure hunt mobile game and event manager.

## How does it work?

You can find events by following your favorite creators, or by just exploring nearby "ridls" (we call treasure hunts 'ridls' ðŸ¤«) based on your location. Then you can join the event and get notified when it's about to start.

The first clue is given to you when the event starts, which is in the form of a **riddle** (hmm, everything makes sense now, isn't it.) That can be anything like: "What's a red fruit that has a company named after it" meaning Apple. Assuming you have a big golden statue of an apple in your town, that's where you want to go.

So, you reach there, to the big golden apple. Now what? Well, if we've done our job right, a notification should come to your phone saying that you have reached the objective and you need to find it. Before you get the shovel out of that backpack, open the app and click the little camera button in the bottom. That will open a.. camera. You need to find the treasure through that. AR!

Find it, tap on it and you get the gold! As well as the next clue.

The hunt goes on until you find the final clue. If you find that you win ðŸŽ‰
